Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
- Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles methods and tools to the development and maintainance of high quality software systems.It involves design , development , testing,deployment and maintenance of software products
- software engineering is important in the technology industry as it facilitates creation of software applications, systems that powervarious aspects of modern life which include communication , commerce , entertainment and healthcare 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
- Development of programming languages such as Fortan C
- Establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
- The advent of structured programming in the 1970s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
- Requirements: this process involves gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements 
- Design: Creation of high-level and detailed designs of software architecture and user interface.
- Implementation:this involves the process of writing code and building software according to the design specifications.
- Testing: Various tests are done to ensure the software meets quality stanards and functional requirements.
- Deployment: Software is released to customers
- Maintenance: Providing onoing support, updates and enhancements after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
- waterfall follows a sequential approach which involves distinct phases and could be applied in projects where design and planning phases are required while argile approach is more focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change and can be applied in projects that are rapidly changing. 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
- A software developer is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions
- A Quality Assurance Engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans
- A Project manager oversees planning, execution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
- Intergrated Development Environments are important as they provide comprehensive tools for writing ,debugging and testing code examples are Visual studio , Intelli and ecliplse
- Version Control Systems are software tools that are important for tracking changes to source code and work coordination among team members examples are Git and Subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
- Changing requirements, Tight Deadlines and technical debt and this issues can be overcomed through effective communication, agile methods, prioritisation of tasks and regular reassesment of projrct goals and timelines.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
- Unit testing :this involves testing individual modules of software 
- Intergration testing :this involves testing interactions between differnt subsystems
- Sysem testing :this is testing the entire system as a whole.
- Acceptance testing : involes testing software against user requirements.
- all are important as they help identify and fix defects early in the developments process leading to high quality software.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
- Prompt engineering is the process of crafting questions to get the best possible responses from ai models

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
- BMW cars  an improved version (tell me about  of bmw m5)
- The improved prompt gives me precise information on that specific question
